## ABC COMPANY EMPLOYEE ANALYSIS
Here in this project we are doing the Exploratory Data Analysis of ABC Company employee data set.
There are 458 employees so there are 458 rows 
In this dataset there are 9 variables so there are 9 columns: Name, Team, Number, Position, Age, Height, Weight,College, Salary.

### Pre processing
Analysing all the details of the dataset and also looking for null values.
Here the 'Height' column has incorrect values so first deleted the 'Height' column and again created with random values.


### Questions to be solved:
1. **How many are there in each Team and the percentage splitting with respect to the total employees.**
2. **Segregate the employees w.r.t different positions.**
3. **Find from which age group most of the employees belong to.**
4. **Find out under which team and position, spending in terms of salary is high.**
5. **Find if there is any correlation between age and salary , represent it visually.**

**Note**: this is a fictional dataset used strictly for to demonstrate beginner data analysis skills. 
The results are not official and should not be used to conclude actual relationships between the variables listed and education.
